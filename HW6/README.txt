I use cmake to manage the code.
Here's one way to use it in terminal:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./hw6
After creating the file, you can use "./hw6 < ../sampleinput.txt" to use the sample input I provided.
Tips: In windows, you should use "hw6" instead of "./hw6".
The typical usages for fraction are in main.cpp, you can modify the code to test.

Thank you for your checking.
