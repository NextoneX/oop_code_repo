I use cmake to manage the code.
Here's one way to use it in terminal:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./hw5
After creating the file, you can use "./hw5 < ../sampleinput.txt" to use the sample input I provided.
Tips: In windows, you should use "hw5" instead of "./hw5".





Thank you for checking.
